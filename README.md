# BetBuddy
BetBuddy is a digital platform designed for soccer fans to challenge each other by betting on the outcomes of football matches. Unlike traditional betting platforms, BetBuddy doesn't involve a house—bets are placed directly between two users, making it a peer-to-peer experience driven by knowledge, strategy, and passion for the game.

Whether you're watching with friends or following a major tournament, BetBuddy adds a competitive edge to every match. It’s built as a fun and fair playground where fans can test their predictions, track results, and engage in friendly competition—all within a user-friendly interface
